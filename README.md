# microscopic_data_analysis

Microscopic data most of the times relates to images (i.e., 2D-data). However, sometimes spectral information represents just one-dimensional data or it extends an image by a spectrum at every pixel to a three-dimensional dataset. In a similar way the focus of this package lays on 2D-datasets, but also extends from time to time.

Main features are:

 stitching images on a grid
 
 stack aligning
 
 line detection
 
# Installation
After changing into the directory containing setup.py , install via 

    pip install .  

In the same way (for example: within the Anaconda Prompt, if you are using that) type:

    .\docs\make.bat html

to obtain the documentation in "docs/_build/html/microscopic_data_analysis.html".
For the moment, creating the documentation still results in a few warnings, that can be ignored.
